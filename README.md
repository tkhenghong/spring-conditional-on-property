Test scenarios of @ConditionalOnProperty, to clear out my own confusion

This is a personal project that I did to test out @ConditionalOnProperty in Spring Boot project. The reason why I'm doing this is because I always see this annotation in classes but never fully understand it.
I went to https://www.roytuts.com/spring-conditionalonproperty-example/ to see his example. But I think his explaination is not clear enough on why havingValue = "true" and matchIfMissing = true doesn't make sense.
So I'm interested to find out the reason myself.

You might be interested, so that's why I'm making this project public.

You can play the @ConditionalOnProperty based on scenarios by commenting and uncommenting other scenarios in SpringConfig.java file.

Thanks.
